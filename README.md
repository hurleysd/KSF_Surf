### DESCRIPTION
A .NET mobile application for KSF surf news, information, and statistics. Developed using Visual Studio with Xamarin.Forms, NewtonSoft, and Forms9Patch. This app has been publicly released and available at (iOS) https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ksf-surf/id1512810675 and (Android) https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.seanhurley.KSFSurf&hl=en_US.

This application interfaces the APIs of KSF and Steam to gather data about players, maps, servers, and records. KSF data has been previously only available in-game or on Discord, but this application will provide access to KSF data to anyone with an Android or iOS mobile phone.

### WHAT IS "SURF"?

Surfing is a physics-based gamemode available within Source Engine games due to its bugs. With the correct server settings, players can slide on angled surfaces (known as ramps), manipulate their movement mid-air, and attempt to maximize their speed to complete community-made maps designed specifically for this gamemode. KSF is a community dedicated to the surf gamemode and provides servers that host this gamemode on Counter-Strike: Source and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. With this, KSF also provides ranking and statistics for players to encourage competition and growth. The KSF website can be found [here](http://surftimer.com).
